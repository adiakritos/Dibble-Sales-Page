                    <li>Maybe you find it impossible to <b>assess the risks</b> of taking a certain course of action and are just not sure about what steps to take next.</li> 
                    <li>Maybe you <b>don’t have the time</b> to work out what legal issues apply to your business but equally you <b>don’t have the resources</b> to go to a traditional solicitor and pay their expensive hourly rates?</li> 
                    <li>Maybe you find it all <b>so overwhelming</b> that you prefer to just put your head in the sand and hope that your business is structured the right way and that nothing bad happens.</li> 
                    <li>Or is it just that legal matters <b>aren’t sexy</b> and you would rather be spending your time on bringing more money in and looking after your customers?</li>

                <p class="dontdelete">I know and see all too often the huge impact of small business owners not taking care of legal issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>losing a lot of money</li>
                    <li>having to shell out thousands on legal fees to solve problems</li>

                    <li>having to endure regulatory investigations</li>
                    <li>being fined</li> 
                    <li>in the worst case scenario having to do jail time</li>

                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> But perhaps more importantly, I am concerned about the <b>real impact</b> that these matters have on your <b>quality of life</b> – not being able to take as many holidays or have as much time off, not being able to spend as much time with your family, being under pressure and suffering stress, with the resulting <b>health issues</b> and emotional problems that follow. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> In fact the Legal Services Board Survey found that 9.8% of small business owners had their health adversely affected by legal problems just last year. That means in a 5 year period, you have a 49% chance of a legal problem causing you health problems. A sobering thought. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> And that is why I have put together this first of its kind, comprehensive programme and resources center for small business owners just like you.

Rather than just putting out template documents without any supporting materials, Suzanne has designed a programme that also includes helpful video guides, checklists, action plans - all created to educate and guide small business owners through the most common legal issues that will affect their businesses and to help us put legal documents in place to properly protect and grow our businesses. The video guides have been so helpful and are really added value – for example the 10 minute guides on dealing with suppliers and negotiating was invaluable. Nobody else is offering this added value as far as I'm aware. It's what makes the programme so great.  We have access to template legal documents through a package offered by our bank but what I really like about Suzanne’s templates is that they are so clear, simple and easy to use.”</p>

                <h2 id="about-me" class="center-text">About Suzanne Dibble</h2>
                <p class="dontdelete"> Suzanne Dibble is a hugely experienced business lawyer, having worked at the world’s largest law firm, at FTSE 100 companies and with many famous entrepreneurs, including Richard Branson over her 15 year career. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> Suzanne has also been a board director of a £100m+ turnover company and set up her own legal practice in 2010 and as a result is particularly commercially minded and entrepreneurial in her outlook. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> But what particularly sets Suzanne apart from other lawyers is her understanding of small businesses and the matters that are relevant to them. She has a unique ability to take complex legal issues and break them down into jargon-free, practical, relevant guidance for small business owners. </p> 
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> And it is this straight talking style that has established Suzanne as one of the leading small business law experts in the country – leading to organisations such as Barclays headhunting Suzanne to be the legal expert on their small business site Barclays Connector. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> Suzanne also writes for many other small business magazines such as Real Business, Business Matters, the Small Business Owner Magazine, Women Unlimited and Enterprise Nation, is regularly interviewed on small business law and had her own radio show called Real Life Business Law. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> Suzanne was runner up in the prestigious Solicitor of the Year Award at the Law Society Excellence Awards 2011 and was also shortlisted in the Excellence in Client Service Award.  She was also runner up for the Lawyer magazine’s Solicitor of the Year Award in 2003. Suzanne has won many other national awards. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="dontdelete"> So in summary – she knows her stuff! But after three years of working one on one with clients, Suzanne felt called to transform legal services for small business owners who may previously have felt that quality legal services were out of reach for them. Hence, the creation of the Small Business Legal Academy. </p>

The template documents were very easy to find, download and complete. I found the checklists very useful, particularly the freelance checklist and the freelance status checklist. The programme is excellent value and I feel really fortunate to have found the Small Business Legal Academy. I would definitely recommend the programme to other small business owners. I haven’t seen anything else like this out there - Suzanne has an excellent idea and is onto something good for sure…”</p>

                <h2 id="right-for-you">Is the Small Business Legal Academy for you?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are a small business owner, entrepreneur, online marketer, coach, consultant, expert, practitioner, therapist, freelancer, home worker, online store owner or service provider, this programme is for you <b>whether you are just starting out or are quite established</b>.</li>
                    <li>If you haven’t yet started up your business but are in the <b>process of launching</b> it, this programme is most definitely for you – we have a bonus Start Up module covering all the fundamentals of starting your business. It is so so so much better to establish your business on solid foundations and build on that from the start rather than trying to tidy things up later on.</li>
                    <li>If you are daunted by trying to work out complex legal issues and how the law actually applies to your business, the Academy is a perfect fit for you. I use my 15 years of legal experience and of having worked with hundreds of small business clients to <b>distill down for you the things you really need to know and give you real life examples of how the law actually applies to your business</b>.</li>
                    <li>If you are struggling with understanding the legal jargon that is generally used when talking about legal issues, the Academy is most certainly for you. There is <b>no legal jargon</b> used in any of the materials and I am well known for my straight talking, no nonsense, practical, relevant approach.</li>
                    <li>If you are finding it difficult to know what steps to take next in your business because you lack the confidence to weigh up the risks of a certain course of action (or because you just don’t know what the next steps are) then the Academy is here for you. The materials clearly spell out the consequences of taking a certain course of action <b>making it easy for you to assess the risks and decide which way to proceed</b>.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t have the time to work out what legal issues apply to your business but equally you don’t have the resources to go to a traditional solicitor and pay their expensive hourly rates, then oh my goodness, this programme was created for you! You will be able to <b>leverage my 15 years of legal experience</b> and discover pretty much all you need to know about the most important legal issues that are likely to affect your business in just 5 minutes a week.  You will be able to put in place all the protections you need and discover the foundations on which to grow your business at in a fraction of the price a solicitor would charge – if I was advising you on a one to one basis in relation to all of the matters covered in the programme, your invoice would be well over £20,000.</li>
                    <li>If you find the law overwhelming and you prefer to just put your head in the sand and hope that your business is structured the right way and that nothing bad happens, the Academy is absolutely 100% for you! I regularly see the huge impact on your business, your family time and your health of not taking care of legal issues and the head in the sand approach is just not a winning strategy. To avoid the overwhelm, I have chunked the programme up so that <b>in just 5 minutes a week you will have an overview of the most important legal issues that are likely to affect your business and a clear roadmap of the steps you need to take next</b>.</li>
                    <li>If you think that legal matters aren’t sexy and you would rather be spending your time on bringing more money in and looking after your customers, this programme is for you too! <b>Winning entrepreneurs like Richard Branson</b> (who I used to work with) know the importance of taking care of the legals and building a business on the right foundations. If you don’t want to take care of the nitty gritty, then <b>hand it over to your assistant</b>. Just let us know the name of your assistant and we will make sure that he or she can access all of the materials to put everything in place for you.</li>

                <h2>How is the Academy different to other legal template sites or templates I can get through my bank or my insurers?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>This programme is about so much more than template documents. <b>Template documents without supporting materials are potentially very dangerous. </b>That is why there is so much emphasis in the Academy on the supporting materials like the video guides, the checklists, the webinars and the case studies. You need to know the issue, understand what document you need and be guided through the steps you need to take to protect yourself and this is exactly what the Academy has been designed to do.</li>
                    <li>You need guidance on the documents you actually need to put in place to protect your business. So many small business owners have asked me to review templates they bought and then couldn’t work out only for it to transpire when I review the document that it doesn’t actually protect them against the issue that they thought it did. In the Academy,<b> we guide you through exactly what you need</b>.</li>
                    <li>Most other templates are full of legal terminology that you aren’t likely to understand. And even if you understand it, chances are the person you want to sign the document won’t understand it and therefore won’t want to sign it without running it past a lawyer. And chances are that the other person is not going to want to pay to run it past a lawyer – with the end result that the other person won’t sign it and it has all been a wasted exercise. All of our legal documents are <b>jargon free and are set out as clearly and simply as possible</b>, as evidence by our many testimonials.</li>
                    <li>Are you really staking your business’ health on someone you don’t know’s “expert” legal  knowledge – are they even qualified, is the document up-to-date, does the document cover everything you need? With me you not only are <b>assured of the legal excellence</b> from my training and working for many years at the world’s largest law firm but also the practical experience of having worked with famous entrepreneurs such as Richard Branson, having been a strategic board director of a £100m+ company and having worked with hundreds of small business owners (not to mention being one myself…). If you want to read more about my experience, <a target="_blank" href="#about-me">click here</a>.</li>
                    <li>There are many documents within the Academy that <b>just aren’t available on other template sites</b>. I have used my years of working with hundreds of small business owners to put together a comprehensive programme of all documents and support you are likely to need as a small business owner.</li>
